# Text_Summarization
Every day information is produced rapidly in high volume. And finding the most relevant information from the available abundant information now a days becoming a challenge. So, to tackle these challenges now a days techiniques to extract text summary are proposed. The aim of text summarization is to produce an accurate data summary from the available vast information. We have created this project in python and use two models for that, we use Long Short Term Memory Model(LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM Model(Bi-LSTM). And dataset is used is Amazon Review dataset which is freely available on Kaggle website, you can download the dataset from the Kaggle website.
